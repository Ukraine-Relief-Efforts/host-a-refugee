# Host a Refugee
Host a refugee aims to be a small mobile friendly web app that allows people to sign up as either a host (hosts the refugee) or refugee (the hosted) and then matches these two entities based on specific parameters and regions. This information will then be shared with local immigration / refugee service agencies to aid in efficiently pairing potential hosts and refugees and begin the required background checks and immigration paperwork.
