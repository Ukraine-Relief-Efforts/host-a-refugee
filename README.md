# Host a Refugee

Host a refugee aims to be a small mobile friendly web app that allows people to sign up as either a host (hosts the refugee) or refugee (the hosted) and then matches these two entities based on specific parameters and regions. This information will then be shared with local immigration / refugee service agencies to aid in efficiently pairing potential hosts and refugees and begin the required background checks and immigration paperwork.

We are utilizing the simple GitHub Flow for this project when implementing new features or fixes. All work is to be done on a separate branch prefixed with either "feature/" or "fix/".
